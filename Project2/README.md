# :metal::musical_keyboard: The not so awesome Rock & Roll database :guitar::metal:
The not-so-awesome Rock & Roll app gives you a list of bands, their members, most popular album, the year it was formed , etc. There are only a few bands listed right now ,but you can always add on to it

## Installation
First, you need to clone my repo. To do that open your terminal and type git clone followed by the repo link.

```bash
git clone #repo link#
```
make sure to replace #repo link# with the actual repo link.

Then open VisualStudioCode Bash terminal.


## Populating seed file
cd into the file and run the following command on your terminal

```bash
node seed/songs.js
node seed/albums.js
node seed/beatles.js
node seed/the_who.js
node seed/queen.js
node seed/nirvana.js
```

## Running on Postman
I am going to assume that you have postman downloaded, if not download it.
then start the server in your terminal using the command below

You should be able to run it locally on postman
